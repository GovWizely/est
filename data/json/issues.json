    "abstract": "Arsenic is a semi-metal element. It is odorless and tasteless. It occurs naturally in rocks and soil, water, air, and plants and animals. It can be released into the environment through natural activities such as volcanic action, erosion of rocks, and forest fires. Industry practices such as copper smelting, mining and coal burning also contribute to arsenic in our environment. Because it occurs naturally in the environment and as a by-product of some agricultural and industrial activities, it can enter drinking water through the ground or as runoff into surface water sources. Human exposure to arsenic can cause both short and long term health effects.",

Nutrients stimulate the growth of microorganisms (including algae) and other aquatic vegetation in receiving waters, leading to decreased oxygen levels. Excess nutrients are a significant water quality concern in many of the nations waters and a leading cause of impairment of designated uses. Wastewater treatment facilities are increasingly being required to address this issue by implementing treatment processes that reduce effluent nutrient concentrations to levels that regulators deem sufficiently protective of the environment.",

    "abstract": "Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is one of a group of highly reactive gasses known as \"oxides of nitrogen,\" or \"nitrogen oxides (NOx).\" Other nitrogen oxides include nitrous acid and nitric acid. EPA’s National Ambient Air Quality Standard uses NO2 as the indicator for the larger group of nitrogen oxides. NO2 forms quickly from emissions from cars, trucks and buses, power plants, and off-road equipment. In addition to contributing to the formation of ground-level ozone, and fine particle pollution, NO2 is linked with a number of adverse effects on the respiratory system.",

    "name": "Secondary or Advanced Wastewater Treatment",
    "abstract": "An important aspect of municipal wastewater is that it is amenable to biological treatment. The biological treatment component of a municipal treatment plant is termed secondary treatment and is usually preceded by simple settling (primary treatment). Secondary treatment standards are established by EPA for publicly owned treatment works (POTWs) and reflect the performance of secondary wastewater treatment plants. The secondary treatment standards also provide for special considerations regarding combined sewers, industrial wastes, waste stabilization ponds, less concentrated influent wastewater for combined and separate sewers, and alternative standards for treatment facilities considered equivalent to secondary treatment.",

The types of waste in the universal waste rule are frequently thrown in the trash by unregulated households and small businesses. Classifying an item as a universal waste provides flexibility for its proper management and can prevent the item from entering municipal trash. Instead, it can be readily collected and disposed of at a hazardous waste facility.",
